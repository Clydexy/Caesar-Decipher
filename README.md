# Caesar-Decipher

## Caesar Cipher
The caesar cipher is one of the most well known encryption techniques, dating back to Julius Caesar. It is highly vulnerable to frequency analysis, or even just brute force as there are only 26 or so possibilities, and does not hold up well to Kerckhoff's principle. 

## Brute Force
Brute force is used by the program to find all possible plaintext, and uses the mean squared error between the normalised data of each plaintext candidate and the expected frequencies. This principle can be used in other contexts for brute force in order to find the most English-like solution.

## Improvements
Rather than calculating the frequency matrix for each shifted text, we can simply shift the frequency matrix due to the linear nature of the caesar cipher.
